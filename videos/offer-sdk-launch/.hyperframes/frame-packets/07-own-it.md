## Frame 7 — Yours, on Render, with PayPal

- scene: An architecture diagram assembles inside a box labelled "Your Render account" — API, Postgres, Admin app — then a PayPal lifecycle rail lights up: checkout, renewals, upgrades, pauses, cancellations
- voiceover: "Offer SDK is self-hosted, so the API and the data are yours, running on your own Render account. PayPal handles checkout and the whole subscription lifecycle: renewals, upgrades, pauses and cancellations."
- duration: 13.2s
- transition_in: crossfade
- status: outline
- src: compositions/frames/07-own-it.html
- type: benefit_highlight
- persuasion: Risk reversal (you own the stack and the data)
- beat: control + trust
- blueprint: constellation-hub (Adapt)
- asset_candidates: assets/hero-bg-muted.webp — contour backdrop
- focal: the "Your Render account" boundary with three services
- roles: hero-bg-muted = background (dim ~15%) · services + rail = hero
- sfx: none

narrativeRole: ownership + the payments story in one diagram.
keyMessage: your API, your data, your Render; PayPal runs checkout and the lifecycle.

Adapt: keep constellation-hub's nodes-springing-around-a-center and the connector lines, but the center is a dashed boundary box and the nodes are services; resolve on a lifecycle rail instead of an orbit.
Scene 1 (0.0–2.6s): on "self-hosted" a dashed rounded boundary draws itself (`svg-path-draw`) center-left (~55% width) with a label tab "Your Render account" (text pill, Render wordmark as plain text, no logo).
Scene 2 (2.6–6.4s): on "the API and the data are yours" three service nodes spring into the box in sequence with server/database/layers-2 icons: "offersdk-api" (green Live dot), "Postgres" (green Live dot), "offer-app · admin" (green Live dot); connector lines draw between them (`avatar-cloud-network` connectors). Outside the box on the left, a small "Your app" node connects by a line into offersdk-api.
Scene 3 (6.4–9.0s): on "PayPal handles checkout" a node "PayPal" (blue #0070e0 text wordmark in a rounded tile) slides in on the right and a connector draws from offersdk-api to it; a PayPal-yellow "Checkout" pill pulses once (`press-release-spring`).
Scene 4 (9.0–13.2s): on "the whole subscription lifecycle" a horizontal rail draws under the diagram, and its five stations light up one per spoken word: Checkout · Renewals · Upgrades · Pauses · Cancellations (each a pill with icon: credit-card, refresh-cw, trending-up, circle-pause, door-open; each lights violet with `asr-keyword-glow` on its word). Hold.

## Selected blueprint: constellation-hub

# constellation-hub — Constellation / Hub + Satellites

**intent**: Labeled/iconned nodes spring into a ring/cluster around a center, then the shot resolves on the core — either by pushing the camera INTO the center (depth-of-field collapsing onto it) or by holding a hub mark while the satellites ORBIT it; the "everything connects to / sits around one center" beat.

**roles served**

- Hook (from `hook-cluster-push-in`): a constellation of tool/app nodes springs into a wide ring, then a sustained camera push-in with depth-of-field resolves on the inner core — "it connects everything / one hub for all your tools."
- Social_Proof (from `social-proof-orbit-ecosystem`): the product brand mark lands as the center hub and partner logos spring onto a ring and revolve around it — "plugs into / sits at the center of your stack."
- CTA (from `cta-orbit-collapse`): the ring resolves by COLLAPSE rather than a push-in — category icons drift around an empty central CTA, a cursor click implodes the orbit toward the click point, and the product demo springs OUT of that collapse as the answer (scope → choice → consequence → product).
- Social_Proof (from `proof-logo-chain`): a persistent center logo accrues proofs — its wordmark decodes, a claim ticker swaps, the logo glides to center, then avatars cascade into orbit with drawn connectors while partner logos scroll the bottom strip; four claims read as one statement.
- Social_Proof (from `scatter-drift-finisher`): the ecosystem beat as a
  static END CARD — a two-line serif `[headline]` is the center (no hub mark, no ring), `[~20 app
icons]` pop in scattered frame-wide in a quick stagger, then keep drifting very slowly OUTWARD
  to the end. "Connects to thousands of apps" said with count and spread, not geometry.

**duration**: 5–8s (Hook 5–6s · Social_Proof 5–8s · CTA orbit-collapse ~6s · Social_Proof
scatter-drift end card ~2.5s as a closing beat)

**shot structure**

Consolidated template — nodes ring a center, then one of two finishers resolves on the core.

- Scene 1 (0.0–~1.5s): `[bg]` (dark/space field, optionally slow-drifting diffused gradient blobs). `[primary nodes]` (circles carrying `[icon]` + label) SPRING-POP in (scale 0→1, ~1.15 elastic overshoot, staggered) arranged in a wide ring/cluster around an empty or marked center `[hub]`.
- Scene 2 (~0.7–2.5s, overlapping): smaller `[secondary nodes]` (platform / partner-logo chips) pop in staggered with the same elastic spring, filling the gaps; optional thin `[accent]` connector lines / orbit ring draw from hub→nodes. Camera holds.
- Scene 3 (~2.5–Xs, the resolve): see finisher variant below; lands and HOLDS on the magnified / orbited center to the end.

- Variant — Hook (push-in finisher): from Scene 3, a continuous smooth CAMERA PUSH-IN toward the center inner cluster — inner nodes scale up and stay sharp while outer nodes are pushed toward the edges and progressively BLUR (depth-of-field), background scales up smoothly; holds magnified on the core.
- Variant — Social_Proof (orbit finisher): the center `[brand mark]` snaps in via a quick 3D rotate that decelerates and settles; a thin `[accent]` orbit ring draws around it; `[N partner badges]` spring onto the ring (staggered overshoot) and revolve CLOCKWISE while staying upright, under a continuous slow camera ZOOM-OUT (ecosystem reveal).
- Variant — Social_Proof (optional type-push-through opener, prepended before Scene 1): centered `[headline]` types/slides in with a huge transparent-fill OUTLINE copy of the same words behind it; the outline text scales up exponentially toward camera (high-speed dolly / push-through), breaches the frame, then HARD-CUTS to the hub bg of Scene 1.
- Variant — Social_Proof (scatter-drift finisher, no ring): the center is a two-line serif
  `[headline]` building in place (not a mark); `[~20 app icons]` pop in SCATTERED across the whole
  frame in a quick stagger — no ring geometry, no connectors — then sustain a very slow outward
  drift to the end. Camera fully static: no push-in, no zoom-out; the "everything around one
  center" reads from the drift vectors pointing away from the headline. Often chained as the end
  card of a preceding UI beat (the prior card dissolves into it).

**motion vocabulary**: staggered elastic spring-pop node entrances (~1.15 overshoot); slow gradient-blob drift; connector-line / orbit-ring draw-on; 3D snap-rotate-settle on the hub mark; continuous camera push-in (inner sharp, outer depth-of-field blur, bg scale-up); clockwise orbital revolve of upright badges; continuous slow camera zoom-out (ecosystem reveal); optional outline-text push-through dolly entry. Scatter-drift finisher: frame-wide scattered icon pop-in (staggered, no ring); sustained slow
outward icon drift; in-place two-line serif headline build; static-frame hold to the end.

**rule mapping** (motion verb → `rules/<id>.md`)

- staggered spring-pop node entrances → `spring-pop-entrance` (elastic overshoot) + `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe); 3D-flip-in flavor → `orbit-3d-entry`
- ring / cluster layout of nodes around a center → `avatar-cloud-network` (nodes on an elliptical ring + SVG lines to a center)
- icons on the nodes → `svg-icon-enrichment`
- connector lines hub→node → `svg-path-draw`
- orbit-ring draw-on → `svg-path-draw`
- slow gradient-blob drift → `sine-wave-loop` (idle looped drift)
- 3D snap-rotate-settle on hub mark → `orbit-3d-entry` (3D-flip entry); technique CSS-3D
- clockwise orbital revolve of upright badges → `orbit-3d-entry` (continuous elliptical orbit); technique MotionPath
- camera push-in toward center → `multi-phase-camera` (PUSH-in) + `coordinate-target-zoom` (target the core)
- background scale-up during push-in → `multi-phase-camera`
- continuous slow zoom-out (ecosystem reveal) → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back) / `coordinate-target-zoom`
- outline-text push-through dolly opener (Social_Proof) → `3d-text-depth-layers` (outline copy behind) + `multi-phase-camera` (push-through)
- depth-of-field blur on outer nodes during push-in → `depth-of-field-blur` (progressive DOF/focus-falloff blur on the off-center outer nodes while the inner core stays sharp)
- frame-wide scattered icon pop-in (no ring) → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group) +
  `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe); positions pre-baked scattered — NOT `avatar-cloud-network`'s
  elliptical ring
- sustained slow outward icon drift → `center-outward-expansion` (outward vectors, slow sustained
  register — drift targets sit slightly past the pop-in positions)
- in-place serif headline build → `gsap-effects` (staggered line/word reveal)

**camera modifier**: push-in-with-DOF (Hook) — `multi-phase-camera` PUSH-in targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` onto the core; the focus-falloff blur half of it is backed by `depth-of-field-blur`. Orbit finisher (Social_Proof) — slow continuous zoom-out via `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back) while satellites revolve. Scatter-drift finisher (Social_Proof end card) — none: the frame never moves; the outward drift
is element-level.

# ASR Keyword Glow

Words in a phrase visually activate (glow blur + scale) when "spoken", following an attack-sustain-release envelope over per-word `{ start, end }` timestamps. In a real ASR pipeline the timings come from a word-level transcript (`hyperframes transcribe` — same shape); for promo video, hand-author them to control emphasis pacing. The envelope never falls to zero after a word — it decays to a rest level, leaving a breadcrumb of recent emphasis.

## How It Works

A single linear driver tween (`ease: "none"` — any other ease distorts the per-word envelope; do not change) sweeps scene time; its `onUpdate` loops over ALL words computing each one's envelope: 0 before `start`, linear attack to 1 over `ATTACK_DUR`, sustain at 1 until `end`, decay to `REST_LEVEL` over `RELEASE`, then hold at rest. The envelope drives `text-shadow` blur and `scale` — one driver for the whole phrase, never one tween per word (60+ words would bloat the timeline).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="phrase">
  <span class="word" data-word="{w1Key}">{w1}</span>
  <span class="word" data-word="{w2Key}">{w2}</span>
  <!-- … the final word may be the brand, with the .brand modifier -->
  <span class="word brand" data-word="{brandKey}">{brandWord}</span>
</div>
```

```css
.phrase {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: center;
  color: {restColor};
}
.word {
  display: inline-block; /* required for transform on <span> */
  transform-origin: 50% 50%;
  text-shadow: 0 0 0 {glowColorTransparent};
}
.word.brand {
  color: {brandAccentColor};
}
```

```js
// Per-word spoken windows — one entry per span; brand word 1.5-2× a normal word's window.
const TIMINGS = {
  // {w1Key}: { start: …, end: … },  — seconds, local to the scene
};

function envelope(time, start, end) {
  if (time < start) return 0;
  if (time < end) return Math.min((time - start) / ATTACK_DUR, 1);
  const releaseEnd = end + RELEASE;
  if (time < releaseEnd) return 1 - ((time - end) / RELEASE) * (1 - REST_LEVEL);
  return REST_LEVEL;
}

const words = document.querySelectorAll(".word");
const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: SCENE_DURATION,
    duration: SCENE_DURATION,
    ease: "none", // linear — t maps 1:1 to scene time
    onUpdate: () => {
      words.forEach((el) => {
        const timing = TIMINGS[el.dataset.word];
        if (!timing) return;
        const env = envelope(driver.t, timing.start, timing.end);
        el.style.textShadow = `0 0 ${MAX_BLUR * env}px ${glowColorRgba(env)}`;
        el.style.transform = `scale(${1 + MAX_SCALE_BOOST * env})`;
      });
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

`glowColorRgba(env)` returns the glow color with `env`-modulated alpha.

## Variations

- **Karaoke style (RECOMMENDED for video narration)** — the default amplitudes read too subtle in video: inactive words still dominate. Render inactive words DIM and lerp the active word toward bright + larger; at any moment 1–2 words are bright (spoken + lingering rest) and the rest is dim. Use for short phrases (5–10 words) where one word at a time should POP; keep the subtle default for long dense text. Pushes MAX_BLUR, MAX_SCALE_BOOST, and REST↔ACTIVE contrast; everything else identical:

```js
function lerpChannel(a, b, t) {
  return Math.round(a + (b - a) * t);
}
function colorAt(env, isBrand) {
  const target = isBrand ? BRAND_RGB : ACTIVE_RGB;
  return `rgb(${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.r, target.r, env)}, ${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.g, target.g, env)}, ${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.b, target.b, env)})`;
}
// in onUpdate: el.style.color = colorAt(env, el.classList.contains("brand"));
```

- **Multi-octave glow** — multiply the sustain by `1 + sin(driver.t × PULSE_HZ) × PULSE_AMPLITUDE` so high-emphasis words breathe at peak.
- **Color shift on the peak** — same channel-lerp from `restColor` → `peakColor` as `env` rises (non-karaoke form).
- **3D pop-out** — add `translateZ(env × MAX_POP_Z)` so the spoken word leans toward camera; requires `perspective` on the parent.
- **From real ASR transcripts** — convert `{ word, start_ms, end_ms }` entries to seconds and feed in identically.

| SCENE_DURATION  | = `data-duration`    | same          | driver must end in sync with the scene's seek window       |

## Critical Constraints

- **Timings monotonic, non-overlapping** — every entry's `end` < the next entry's `start`; overlapping windows make the envelope ambiguous.
- **Brand word window 1.5–2× a normal word** — the brand is the headline; let it sustain.
- **Driver ease stays `"none"`** — any other ease warps every word's envelope timing.
- **`text-shadow`, not `box-shadow`** — the glow must hug the GLYPH (speaking emphasis), not the inline-block rectangle.
- **One driver looping all words** — never one tween per word.
- **Commit to a style** — values between the default and karaoke columns yield awkward "half-loud" emphasis.
- **Climax dwell ≥1s** after the final word's emphasis — the last word IS the headline beat.

# Avatar Cloud Network

Avatars on an elliptical ring around a central hub (logo / counter), with SVG dashed lines drawing outward from the hub to each avatar — "community" / social proof. Distinct from [orbit-3d-entry.md](orbit-3d-entry.md) (continuous orbit): this settles into a static composed formation.

## How It Works

Three layers: SVG lines (z-index 1, behind), avatars (z-index 2), hub (z-index 5 — lines terminate AT its edge, never pass through). Avatar positions and lines are built once at setup from ONE shared center; the timeline then runs hub fade → avatar cascade → outward line draw → breathing dwell. Drawing FROM the center is the narrative: "the hub connects to its community."

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<svg class="lines" viewBox="0 0 1920 1080"><!-- lines injected --></svg>
<div class="hub-wrap">

  <!-- avatars injected -->
</div>
```

}
```

```js
// CENTER_X/Y must equal the hub's RENDERED center exactly — every avatar
// position and line endpoint derives from it. For a place-items:center hub on
// a 1920×1080 canvas: (W/2, H × CENTER_Y_FACTOR).
const C = { x: CENTER_X, y: CENTER_Y };
const wrap = document.querySelector(".hub-wrap");
const svg = document.querySelector(".lines");

for (let i = 0; i < AVATAR_COUNT; i++) {
  const a = (i / AVATAR_COUNT) * Math.PI * 2 - Math.PI / 2; // start at top
  const x = C.x + Math.cos(a) * RADIUS_X;
  const y = C.y + Math.sin(a) * RADIUS_Y;

  const av = document.createElement("div");
  av.className = "avatar"; // assign image / glyph from authoring data
  av.style.left = `${x}px`;
  av.style.top = `${y}px`;

  const attrs = {
    x1: C.x,
    y1: C.y,
    x2: x,
    y2: y,
    stroke: "{lineColor}",
    "stroke-dasharray": "6 8",
  };
  Object.entries(attrs).forEach(([k, v]) => line.setAttribute(k, String(v)));
  const len = Math.hypot(x - C.x, y - C.y); // straight line — Math.hypot, not getTotalLength()
  line.style.strokeDashoffset = String(len);
  svg.appendChild(line);
}

tl.from(".hub", { opacity: 0, scale: 0.8, duration: HUB_DUR, ease: `back.out(${HUB_BOUNCE})` }, 0);

const avatars = document.querySelectorAll(".avatar");
avatars.forEach((av, i) => {
  tl.from(
    av,
    { opacity: 0, scale: 0, duration: AVATAR_DUR, ease: `back.out(${AVATAR_BOUNCE})` },
    AVATAR_AT + i * AVATAR_STAGGER,
  );
});
svg.querySelectorAll("line").forEach((line, i) => {
  tl.to(
    line,
    { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: LINE_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
    LINES_AT + i * LINE_STAGGER,
  );
});

// Climax dwell — out-of-phase breathing holds the eye on the formed network:
// one phase proxy (0 → 2π·BREATH_CYCLES, ease "none"); onUpdate scales avatar i by
// 1 + sin(p + (i/n)·2π) · BREATH_AMP — sine-wave-loop's multiplicative onUpdate form.
// Keep the -50% centering in the same transform write.
```

## Variations

- **Size variety**: vary avatar sizes by a small index-keyed array so the ring doesn't read rigidly repetitive.
- **Solid lines**: drop the dash + draw; lines fade in via opacity — more corporate, less networky.
- **Multi-orbit**: inner ring (fewer, larger) connected to the hub; outer ring is an unconnected "halo."
- **Glyph avatars**: flags / emoji / icons instead of faces — reads "global community" or role spread.

| BREATH_CYCLES  | 1.0–2.0 over the remaining s | under 1 = single sigh; over 2 = anxious. BREATH_AMP 0.02–0.06    |

Tokens: dark `{bgColor}` so the cloud reads as a constellation; translucent accent `{lineColor}`; soft border + glow keeps avatars legible on dark.

## Critical Constraints

- **CENTER_X/Y must match the hub's actual rendered center** — when composed with another scene (e.g. a recentered logo), bake them from the same source as the hub's final position, or lines visibly miss the hub.
- **Hub z-index above lines** — lines terminate at the hub edge, never cross it.
- **Lines draw outward** (dashoffset len → 0), starting after avatars are mostly settled.
- **`RADIUS_X > RADIUS_Y`** — a horizontal ellipse reads as perspective; a circle reads flat.
- **Climax dwell ≥ 1s** after lines complete so the formed network is readable.
- Straight lines: `Math.hypot` for length — `getTotalLength()` not needed.

# Press-Release Spring Chain

Separates input (linear compression) from output (spring recovery) to create tactile feel: the overshoot is a natural byproduct of the spring config, not manually coded, with secondary motion (shadow shrink, release burst, background glow) layered on the same trigger frame. This is a **reaction on an element already resting on screen** — an arrival that springs in from nothing is [spring-pop-entrance.md](spring-pop-entrance.md); add a visible cursor actor and it becomes [physics-press-reaction.md](physics-press-reaction.md).

Two phases split at the **release**:

1. **Press**: linear ease → compression (`scale: 1 → PRESS_SCALE`, shadow shrinks). Linear, not spring — the dip must read as instant/tactile, not squishy.
2. **Release**: `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` spring back to 1.0. Optional burst glow ring expands behind the button; optional environmental glow fades in.

State continuity is critical: the release tween's start value MUST equal the press tween's end value, or the spring snaps to a different position. GSAP threads this automatically when both tweens target the same property at **adjacent positions** — `RELEASE_START = PRESS_START + PRESS_DUR`; a gap or overlap breaks it.

## Variations

- **Subtle press** (status save / muted CTA): `PRESS_SCALE` ~0.96, `BOUNCE_FACTOR` ~1.4, burst scale/opacity reduced.
- **Dramatic press** (hero CTA / "ship it"): `PRESS_SCALE` ~0.88, `BOUNCE_FACTOR` ~2.5, burst maxed.
- **Color shift during press** — darken mid-press, return on release; interpolated `backgroundColor` at the same timeline positions as the scale tweens. Same state-continuity rule.
- **State change at release** (approve / confirm) — instead of returning to the rest color, swap to `{successColor}` at `RELEASE_START` and pop a checkmark via a separate `back.out(CHECK_BOUNCE)` tween (1.4–2.0, firmer than the button's bounce — a punctuating "stamp"; pop 0.3–0.6 s) at the same position. The button is now terminal — no further presses expected.

| RELEASE_DUR          | 0.40–0.90 s                                | shorter = tight pop; longer = loose, wobbly settle                                         |

| BURST_PEAK_SCALE     | 3 subtle · 6 default · 8 max               | beyond ~8 the radial gradient pixelates visibly                                            |

| BG_GLOW_PEAK_OPACITY | 0.1 subtle · 0.25 default · 0.45 max       | higher washes the whole composition; fade-in 0.6–1.0 s; inset −300…−500 px at 1080p        |

Color tokens: pressed surface darker than rest; rest shadow large + diffuse, pressed small + tight (the button "sinks toward the surface"); burst gradient darker + more saturated than `{btnBg}` — same-color glow looks washed out; bg glow a low-opacity tint of the button's hue family.

## Critical Constraints

- **State continuity** — release start value exactly equals press end value; enforced by same-property adjacency at `RELEASE_START = PRESS_START + PRESS_DUR`.
- **Linear press, spring release** — both spring → squishy; both linear → mechanical, no overshoot punch.
- **Anchor compression on center** (`transform-origin: 50% 50%`) or the button collapses asymmetrically.
- **Burst behind, not in front** — burst `z-index: 1`, button `z-index: 2`; in front it occludes the button at peak opacity.
- **Don't tween `boxShadow` and `filter` on the same element** — they compete in the layout pipeline; shadow on the button, blur on the separate burst layer.
- **Climax dwell** — after the burst peak + reveal, the composition must run ≥ 1 s more (≥ 2 s for dramatic variants); a reveal at `t = DURATION − 0.2 s` reads as "flashed and gone."

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
